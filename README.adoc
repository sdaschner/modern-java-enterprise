= Enterprise Coffee

The example project of my _Modern Enterprise Java from the ground up_ presentation.

Comprises a _coffee-shop_ application, which can be deployed locally, or to a Kubernetes and Istio cluster.

== Local Docker

In order to run the Docker containers locally, execute `./docker-run-local.sh`.
